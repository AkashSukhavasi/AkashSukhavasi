<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Akash 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer | MS-DA @ GMU</h3>

### About me

I am an aspiring **Engineer** and a staunch believer in the **Open Source** mission. My focus is on building resilient, performance-oriented infrastructure that solves real-world problems. I believe that "building in public" is the most effective way to drive innovation and create a more transparent tech landscape.

### 🛠️ What I'm Focused On

* 🔭 **Systems Engineering:** I’m moving deep into the stack to understand how to build infrastructure that lasts. 
* 🌱 **Learning Rust:** I am currently exploring the world of memory safety and low-level performance. I'm a beginner today, but I'm committed to the long-term journey of mastering the borrow checker.
* 💬 **Ask me about:** My experience with **data optimization**. In past projects, I've helped design ingestion workflows, an experience I’m now applying to systems-level thinking.
* ⚡ **The Mission:** Bridging the gap between high-level tools and low-level performance. I want to build the "plumbing" that makes software faster and safer for everyone.
* 🏗️ **Infrastructure & Innovation:** Interested in how code impacts the physical world, from smart infrastructure to software that serves the public good.

### 🦀 Why Rust?

I'm transitioning to Rust because I believe it is the future of **Software** and **Reliability**.
- **The Goal:** To move from a user of tools to a builder of the engines that power them.
- **The Approach & Contribution:** Learning by doing: expect to see small, experimental, and public contributions as I find my footing.
